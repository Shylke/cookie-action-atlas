# Cookie Action - *Ver. 5.2.6*

## Bug Fixes
* Fixed `a!cookie award/remove` accepting null values, or any other value that wasn't a number.
* Fixed the balance reward role relying on *belly* balance.

## New Features
* `a!cookie set` ‚Äî similar to `a!cookie award/remove` but sets a value instead of adding/removing it. For when you're too lazy to do the math.
* You can now change the name's and emoji's currency (deafault is `cookie(s)` and `üç™`).
* New variables: `EmojiBal`, `NameBal` (with its respective variants: `NameBalS`, `NameBalP`, `NameBalCS`, `NameBalCP`), and `NameAction`.
* Renamed `CookieAmount` to `BalanceAmount`, and `CookieAmountBelly` to `BellyAmount`.
* Added 1 random response for `a!cookie sacrifice`.

## Roadmap
* Remove the Role Reward when it goes under the thresold when using `a!cookie remove`.
* `a!cookie reset` should tell when someone's balance is already 0. ***Low priority***
* Checking someone else's cookie balance should set it to zero, should their value be null. ***High priority***
* Move some of the subcommands to the second action script since the first one hit the 15k limit. ***High priority***



# Cookie Action - *Ver. 4.4.0*

## Bug Fixes 
* Fixed the long ass message when it included the reward part as well.

(I still haven't figured out how to get the reward message to show at the end.)

## New Features
* `a!cookie info` ‚Äî redirects you to my shiny new GitHub-powered [website](https://shylke.github.io/cookie-action-atlas).
* You can now set rewards for both the amount of cookies you have (Balance), and the amount of cookies you have eaten (Belly). Used to support only the latter before.
* ... or you can disable them altogether by clearing the `RoleRewardID` and/or `RoleRewardBellyID` variable(s).
* New Variables: `RoleRewardBellyID`, `CookieAmount`, `CookieAmountBelly`!
* You can now *easily* set the amount of cookies you need in order to get a reward, mess around with the `CookieAmount` and `CookieAmountBelly` variables.
* Now it'll properly display the role you have set for reward in the reward messages. Used to be "Cookie Lover" before.
* `a!cookie chnagelog` has changed to include only the link to this page.
* Updated [README.md](https://github.com/Shylke/cookie-action-atlas/blob/master/README.md) page.
